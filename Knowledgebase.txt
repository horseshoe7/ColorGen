I started with this blog post:  https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/command-line-tool-package-manager/

But it was out of date, in terms of the ArgumentParser framework.

Just following the docs of the ArgumentParser framework got me further.

The next issue arose when trying to write unit tests.  Sometimes it would appear to have failed, but I think this is an Xcode caching issue.

If you look at the Package manifest, it looks pretty straightforward, except when it comes to resources.

I think the SPM requires a specific folder structure.  The following helped:

- Have a look at this post, and consider refactoring to basically follow its format:
